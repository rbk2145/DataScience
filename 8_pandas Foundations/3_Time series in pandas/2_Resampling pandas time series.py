###Resampling and frequency
# Downsample to 6 hour data and aggregate by mean: df1
df1 = df['Temperature'].resample('6h').mean()

# Downsample to daily data and count the number of data points: df2
df2 = df['Temperature'].resample('D').count()


####Separating and resampling
# Extract temperature data for August: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-August']

# Downsample to obtain only the daily highest temperatures in August: august_highs
august_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Extract temperature data for February: february
february = df['Temperature']['2010-Feb']

# Downsample to obtain the daily lowest temperatures in February: february_lows
february_lows = february.resample('D').min()


####Rolling mean and frequency
# Extract data from 2010-Aug-01 to 2010-Aug-15: unsmoothed
unsmoothed = df['Temperature']['2010-Aug-01':'2010-Aug-15']

# Apply a rolling mean with a 24 hour window: smoothed
smoothed = unsmoothed.rolling(window=24).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame with columns smoothed and unsmoothed: august
august = pd.DataFrame({'smoothed':smoothed, 'unsmoothed':unsmoothed})

# Plot both smoothed and unsmoothed data using august.plot().
august.plot()
plt.show()


#####Resample and roll with it
# Extract the August 2010 data: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-Aug']

# Resample to daily data, aggregating by max: daily_highs
daily_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Use a rolling 7-day window with method chaining to smooth the daily high temperatures in August
daily_highs_smoothed = august.resample('D').max().rolling(window=7).mean()
print(daily_highs_smoothed)
